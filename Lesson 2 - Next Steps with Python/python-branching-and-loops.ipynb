        ">  This tutorial is a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) - a document made of \"cells\", which can contain explanations in text or code written in Python. Code cells can be executed and their outputs e.g. numbers, messages, graphs, tables, files etc. can be viewed within the notebook, which makes it a really powerful platform for experimentation and analysis. Don't afraid to experiment with the code & break things - you'll learn a lot by encoutering and fixing errors. You can use the \"Kernel > Restart & Clear Output\" menu option to clear all outputs and start again from the top of the notebook.\n",

        "1. Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Make sure to add Conda binaries to your system `PATH` to be able to run the `conda` command line tool from your Mac/Linux terminal or Windows command prompt.\n",

This technique of structuring code by adding spaces is called *indentation*.\n",

Indent your code by placing the cursor at the start of the line and pressing the `Tab` key once to add 4 spaces. Pressing `Tab` again will indent the code further by 4 more spaces, and press `Shift+Tab` will reduce the indentation by 4 spaces.\n",
